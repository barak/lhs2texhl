  Literate HS to TeX Highlighter Helper
  =====================================
  
  Hi there,
  
  This is the very first release of the lhs2tex helper for syntax highlighting.
  Use it in addition with lhs2tex. Due to a huge demand I make this tool 
  publicly available. Use it your own risk. I am not responsible for any
  conveniences or inconveniences caused by using this software.
  
  Regards,
  Alessandro Vermeulen
  
  INSTALLING
  ----------
  
  * Download the zip file.
  * Extract
  * Go to the directory and run
    > cabal install
    
  * That's all
  
  USAGE
  -----
  
  > lhs2texhl INPUTFILE OUTPUTFILE
  
  Currently this is the only way to work with the tool.
  
  In your .tex files add %include OUTPUFILE to tell lhs2tex to use the generated
  formatting directives. You'll need to provide the following commands yourself:
  
  * \lhsCHkeyword
  * \lhsCHprelude
  * \lhsCHtype
  * \lhsCHlitNumber
  * \lhsCHconstructor
  * \lhsCHfunction
  
  KNOWN ISSUES
  ------------
  
  * Infix operators may not work that great, or normal functions that are used
    `infix`.
  * It doesn't do strings and char highlighting yet.
  * AGDA isn't supported yet unfortunately.
  * Errors aren't that informative. :)
