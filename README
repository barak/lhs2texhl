  Literate HS to TeX Highlighter Helper
  =====================================
  
  Hi there,
  
  This is the very first release of the lhs2tex helper for syntax highlighting.
  Use it in addition with lhs2tex. Due to a huge demand I make this tool 
  publicly available. Use it your own risk. I am not responsible for any
  conveniences or inconveniences caused by using this software.
  
  It aims to detect the `kind' of a token either by it's use or it's
  declaration. Trying to detect both local declarations and usages.
  
  Regards,
  Alessandro Vermeulen
  
  INSTALLING
  ----------
  
  * Download the zip file.
  * Extract
  * Go to the directory and run
    > cabal install
    
  * That's all
  
  USAGE
  -----
  
  > lhs2TeX-hl -o OUTPUTFILE INPUTFILE
  
  For more details see:
  
  > lhs2TeX-hl --help
  
  Currently this is the only way to work with the tool.
  
  In your .tex files add %include OUTPUFILE to tell lhs2tex to use the generated
  formatting directives. You'll need to provide the following commands yourself:
  
  * \lhsCHsyntax
  * \lhsCHkeyword
  * \lhsCHprelude
  * \lhsCHtype
  * \lhsCHconstructor
  * \lhsCHfunction
  * \lhsCHinfixoperator
  * \lhsCHclass
  
  This only generates formatting directives for keywords for you. If you want to
  change the formatting of characters, strings or literal numbers add the
  following directives:
  
  > %subst char a    	= "\color{char}\text{\tt ''" a "''}"
  > %subst string a  	= "\color{string}\text{\tt \char34 " a "\char34}"
  > %subst numeral a =  "\color{numeral}{ " a " }"
  
  KNOWN ISSUES
  ------------
  
  * Infix operators may not work that great, or normal functions that are used
    `infix`. Sometimes you might get an `ambiguous infix operator' error.
  * AGDA isn't supported yet unfortunately.
  * Errors aren't that informative. :)
  
  CHANGES
  -------
  1.2.1:  * Fixed a regression, detection of language pragmas was apparently
            broken and now they aren't anymore.
  1.2.0:  * Hopefully the ``ambiguous infix operator'' error shouldn't occur 
            that often anymore.
          * Removed the AGDA dependency for until it actually works.
          * Classes are now detected.
